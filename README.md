# Final-Project-Game-Jam-

The goal of this project was a game jam wherein which a 4-memeber team would be given 3 days to finish a game of their choice. Our game is called "Bird of Nightmares" in which the goal is to get from one end of the city to another while avoiding hitting the buildings and falling meteors.
